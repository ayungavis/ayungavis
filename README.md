Hi! 👋️ I'm Wahyu, a software engineer with a background in programming and design. I've enjoyed experiences in web and mobile development especially as front end developer 💕


#### 🥅️ Focus and goal

Currently I'm focused on building applications with sensible user interfaces and good user experiences that help people discover and connect with each other. My mission is to make technology more accessible and enjoyable to the masses and I love exploring new frameworks and languages to accomplish that.

💻️ Operating System: **Mac OS**

🎉️ Frontend Dev:

- React / NextJS (really love it!) ❤️
- React Native (mobile dev purpose)
- Tailwind / Chakra UI / Material UI (css frameworks that's help me)

♨️ Backend Dev:

- Laravel / Lumen (used for creating fast REST API)
- Express / Adonis (used for long term project)
- Firebase (for fast dev with React)

✍️ Programming Language:

- JavaScript / TypeScript (really love it!) ❤️
- PHP (my first programming language that I learned)


#### ☕️ Wanna a cup of coffee?

When I'm not coding, I'm probably dreaming about building great user interface design and code it. I also enjoy drinking coffe ☕️
